TODO:

AppDelegate:

 - Setup the Icon to split RAM and CPU reporting
 - Define seperate rendering regions for CPU and RAM icons
 
 
Figure out if I want to write 1 icon renderer or split it into two?  Do I want to to the leg work of differentiating the two in the app delegate or in teh icon maker?!?

IconMaker:
 - Render RAM in different color scheme (blue?!?)
 - Smartly render the size of the grid if the image if half or full size
 
  
   
Monitor:
 - Figure out how to do real-time CPU usage rporting, not clear!
 - Do I need to store the data and track it myself?!
